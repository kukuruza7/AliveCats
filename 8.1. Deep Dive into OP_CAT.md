## Delving Deeper into Bitcoin Covenants

**Recap: Unraveling the Technical Aspects of OP_CAT**

Our venture into the intricacies of Bitcoin's design continues, focusing on covenants enabled by Taproot and the hypothetical CAT opcode. Unlike regular transactions, covenants set specific conditions for spending coins. Building on our previous exploration of fixed Schnorr signatures and CAT, this post delves into the realm of recursive covenants. These distinctive structures dictate that coins spent from a covenant must return to the same or a similar covenant. Join us as we navigate the technical intricacies of recursive covenants within the Bitcoin landscape.

**Concerns and Evolution of Covenants in Bitcoin**

Before we delve into the technicalities, it's essential to understand the historical context and concerns surrounding recursive covenants.

In 2013, [Greg Maxwell introduced the concept of covenants[(https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=278122.0), opening the door for potential misuse. Users speculated about the possibility of creating one-way covenants, preventing coins from moving out, leading to concerns about surveillance and transaction censorship.

Blockstream's Elements Alpha in 2015 embraced covenants, promoting experimentation in a no-value environment. Later, Möser, Eyal, and Sirer proposed a "vault" construction in 2016, leveraging covenants to thwart fast coin theft.

In 2019, [Jeremy Rubin suggested opcode solutions](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2019-May/016934.html) like CHECKOUTPUTSHASHVERIFY, SECURETHEBAG, and CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY. Simultaneously, [Russell O'Connor proposed](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2019-May/016946.html) adding CHECKSIGFROMSTACK and CAT to Bitcoin to enable covenants more flexibly. However, concerns about inefficiency and the stigma of fully-general covenants impeded progress.

Fears persisted until Ethan Heilman highlighted that "permanently-tainted-coin covenants" were feasible using CHECKMULTISIG. While acknowledging potential risks, he emphasized the barriers preventing malicious use. Attempts to construct dark covenants failed, indicating practical challenges and dispelling some fears.

These insights led to a shift in perspective, suggesting that covenant fears might be exaggerated. As this series unfolds, we'll explore the evolving landscape of covenants, acknowledging their inevitability in Bitcoin's extended functionality. While concerns persist, there's a growing recognition of the need for covenants, paving the way for serious proposals in the future.

**Vault Construction**

Let's explore the concept of Vaults—a robust construction involving two covenant scripts designed to govern coin spending.

*Vault Output:*

  Requires a signature from a fixed "hot key."
  Permits coins to be sent only to a staging output.

*Staging Output:*

  Enables coins to be spent in two ways:
  After a timelock expires, coins move to a pre-set target destination.
  At any time, using a "cold key," coins can return to the same script, establishing a new target and resetting the timelock.
  
The approach ensures that coins remain dormant until the user initiates movement. To transfer them, users must first send coins to a "waiting area," subject to a timelock. Possession of the cold key by the original user makes it impossible for attackers to access the funds. In the worst-case scenario, an attacker with the cold key can engage in a prolonged battle with the rightful owner, each attempting to reset the timelock without gaining access to the funds.

**Value Switching for Covenants**

In our exploration of recursive covenants, we encountered a challenge—computing a taproot commitment in Script+CAT without knowledge of the commitment's discrete logarithm. Without the ability to commit to a script, sending coins dynamically to various destinations becomes a puzzle. While we can't use this approach for vaults, an interesting solution called "value switching" presents itself.

*Value Switching Concept:*

  Establish a range of predefined destinations.
  Enable users to choose a destination by setting the low byte of the output value.
  The script verifies this value (committed in the sig hash) to determine allowable spending.

While valuable for constructing multi-script state machines with loops, I won't delve into its details here as it's not essential for vaults. Feel free to explore this intriguing concept further.

**Transaction Preimaging in Vault Construction**

In crafting the vault's recursive structure, we encounter the need to set a "target destination" parameter. To handle this, we employ the following strategy:

The vault script, restricting coin movement to a staging output, necessitates being spent with precisely two outputs.

The first output is constrained to have its scriptPubKey as the staging script and its value matching that of the input.

The second output, with no restrictions, serves as our target destination and fulfills various roles.

a. Defines the scriptPubKey for the target destination.

b. Acts as a change output for the transaction.

c. Facilitates child-pays-for-parent for fee bumping.

Applying covenant restrictions on the output side involves using CAT and CHECKSIG, requiring a signature hash consisting of specific data. This includes SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY, version, locktime, hash of all outputs, and more. Implementing these restrictions follows techniques discussed in the previous blog post, and details may be elaborated later upon actual implementation.

The second output's scriptPubKey is seemingly unrestricted, but its significance becomes apparent when examining the staging output's script. Two spending paths are considered:

Using the Cold Key:

Similar to the vault script with the cold key replacing the hot key.
The output scriptPubKey is not fixed but must match the input value+scriptPubKey.

Unvaulting:

Waits for the timelock to expire and moves coins to the target destination.
Check that the coins indeed move to the target destination.
No need to enforce funding transaction conditions upfront; verification occurs at the unvaulting stage.

While exact script details are omitted for brevity, the approach ensures that the target destination is achieved while maintaining security and flexibility within the vault's recursive structure.

**In Summary: Recursive Covenants and the Future**

While we omitted certain details, this post delved into two approaches for creating recursive covenants using CAT: value switching and transaction pre-imaging. These methodologies were then applied to construct a vault.

In the upcoming post, we will explore leveraging these techniques to emulate the "rebinding" functionality proposed by Lightning Network developers, demonstrating how CAT is effective for maintaining constant-sized payment channel backups.

For our final discussion, we'll examine the Miniscript model of Script, aiming to enhance the manageability of complex Script constructions and make them more accessible for analysis.
