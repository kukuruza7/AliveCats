## Smile!
1. Why did `OP_CAT` go to the coding party? It wanted to concatenate the fun!
2. `OP_CAT` and `OP_SWAP` walk into a bar. The bartender says, "Can I push you a joke?" They reply, "Just pop it on the stack!"
3. How does `OP_CAT` express its feelings? It concatenates a range of emotions!
4. What did the programmer cat say to its friend? "I'm going to concatenate a purr-fect script!"
5. Why did the script bring a magnifying glass? It wanted to see the small details concatenate into something big!
6. How does `OP_CAT` handle relationships? It believes in concatenating hearts, not breaking them!
7. What did the zero say to the one? "Let's concatenate and make a perfect '10' together!"
8. Why did the script break up with `OP_SUB`? It wanted to avoid subtracting happiness and concatenate joy instead!
9. What's a programmer's favorite bedtime story? "The Concatenation Chronicles: Once upon a stack..."
10. Why did the script go to therapy? It had issues with unresolved concatenation!

In the world of programming, humor is like a well-commented codeâ€”makes everything clearer and brighter. May the smiles generated by those jokes be as infectious as a good laugh at a debugging session. If programming jokes could compile happiness, consider your day fully optimized!
