## Technical Deep Dive into OP_CAT

Exploring Bitcoin covenants with a tool called `CAT`.[[6](https://www.wpsoftware.net/andrew/blog/cat-and-schnorr-tricks-i.html)] Picture `CAT` as a magical merger of info. It used to be in Bitcoin, took a break, but we're reviving it. Now, pair it with something called `CHECKSIGFROMSTACK` (never really in Bitcoin, just go with it).

Covenants act like guardians for your Bitcoin transactions, setting specific spending conditions. `CAT` combines data pieces, and with `CHECKSIGFROMSTACK`, it's like peeking into the transaction to verify everything.

You provide the whole transaction, `CAT` bundles it, and we check if the signature matches. If yes, it's like a double-check for your provided transaction data. Opens doors for secure and controlled Bitcoin transactions. Exciting, right? More coming in this series!

**Understanding ECDSA Signatures and Near-Covenants in Bitcoin**

Imagine we have a powerful tool called `CHECKSIGFROMSTACK` but lack `CAT`. We dream of creating a simple covenant where users provide a hash of all transaction data, and the script verifies it using both `CHECKSIG` and `CHECKSIGFROMSTACK`. Without `CAT`, the script can't rebuild the hash from separate parts of the data. So, it ends up merely checking if the hash matches a specific value. This means the coins can only be spent on one particular transaction.

We are thinking about expanding this idea for a few transactions but setting broader conditions like "any transaction with outputs less than 1 BTC" seems impossible.

However, reality hits. This covenant plan faces a technical hurdle. `CHECKSIG` checks transaction data, including the txid of the previous transaction. Here's the catch: the txid involves hashing the covenant script itself. Even with the `SIGHASH_SINGLE` bug workaround, the script would need its hash to be effective, which turns out to be impossible.

Now, here's where it gets interesting. Despite the hash circularity problem, Bitcoin has a method to get the transaction hash onto the stack. If not for this issue, we'd have covenants in Bitcoin today. Additionally, if we could sign transaction data without involving details from the previous transaction (thanks to proposals like `SIGHASH_NOINPUT` in the Lightning Network world), covenants would be part of Bitcoin. Let's explore how this would work:

ECDSA signatures work with a keypair (x, P = xG), representing signing and verification keys. The mapping xâ†¦xG converts scalars to elliptic curve points. It's homomorphic (x+y)G=xG+yG, and reversing it is believed to be impossible without a quantum computer.

Generating an ECDSA signature involves an ephemeral keypair (k, R = kG) and computing the value r, the first component of R. The value s is then computed as s = k^(-1)(H + rx), where H is the hash of the transaction data. Let's break it down:
<pre>
skG = HG + rxG
sR = HG + rP
</pre>
Rearranging, we get:
<pre>
P = r^(-1)(sR - HG)
</pre>
This becomes a cryptographic hash of the transaction data for fixed R and s, as long as H is. Bitcoin Script has an opcode for this: `CHECKSIG`.

In practical terms, imagine a script like DUP <fixed signature> `SWAP CHECKSIGVERIFY`. It's satisfied only if the user provides a pubkey P that fits. The script duplicates and swaps it with a fixed signature, then calls `CHECKSIGVERIFY` on \<sig> \<P>. If the equation is satisfied, these are consumed, leaving a copy of P on the stack. If not, the script fails, and the transaction is invalid.

Two key takeaways: getting covenants in Bitcoin is quite straightforward, and by bending the rules of digital signature algebra, we can place transaction data on the stack using signature-checking opcodes.

**BIP340 Signatures and Key-Prefixing**

In Taproot, BIP340 signatures introduce a simplified Schnorr signature variant with unique challenges. These signatures, denoted by the same keys and elliptic curve, incorporate P (public key) explicitly in the signature hash, classifying them as "signatures of knowledge."

Despite this complexity, it's revealed that BIP340 signatures can be manipulated for non-signature behavior, especially when combined with the `CAT` opcode. The manipulation involves fixing R and P to derive a legitimate transaction hash from s.

Illustrating this, consider the script /<G> `2DUP SWAP CAT SWAP CHECKSIG`. This script efficiently processes the s value of the signature, resulting in a `SHA256` hash of the transaction data. The SHA256 opcode, along with the hypothetical `CAT` opcode, facilitates transaction data validation against the hash, akin to `CHECKSIGFROMSTACK`.

Adjusting for the +1 in the hash becomes feasible by having the user modify their transaction data. This simple adjustment, done until the hash ends with the byte 01, aligns with the script's requirements.

In essence, exploring BIP340 signatures and key-prefixing unveils intriguing possibilities for covenants, showcasing Bitcoin's scripting capabilities in creative ways.

**Exploring BIP340 Signatures in Taproot**

BIP340 signatures in Taproot, designed for covenant resistance, unexpectedly bring us closer to covenants with the CAT opcode. Despite challenges in constructing recursive covenants, intriguing possibilities emerge. Can these sighash-templating covenants find practical applications within Script consensus limits? Stay tuned as we delve into innovative uses, including simulating `SIGHASH_NOINPUT` and constructing Vaults, showcasing ongoing scripting innovations in Bitcoin.
