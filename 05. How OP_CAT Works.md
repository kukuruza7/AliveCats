## **How does OP_CAT work?**

`OP_CAT`, within the Bitcoin network, played a crucial role as a fundamental tool, bringing together different pieces of information to create new and innovative transactions. Its primary task was to combine data, essentially acting as the digital adhesive that binds various elements within the Bitcoin network.

You can think of an opcode as a step in a recipe, like “chop the onions” or “boil water.” It tells the computer (or in this case, the Bitcoin network) what to do with the data it has. For example, an opcode might tell the network to add two numbers together, check if one number is larger than another, or combine two pieces of data.

Each opcode is a basic building block that, when combined with others, creates the complex rules and conditions for how transactions operate on the blockchain. Many opcodes remain active from that time period.[[4](https://blockworks.co/news/op-cat-bitcoin-taproot-wizards)]

Here is a **simple example** of how to use the `OP_CAT` opcode in Bitcoin Script:
<pre>
OP_PUSHDATA1 <data1>
OP_PUSHDATA2 <data2>
OP_CAT
</pre>
In this example, `OP_PUSHDATA1` and `OP_PUSHDATA2` are opcodes that push data onto the stack `OP_CAT` is the opcode that concatenates the two pieces of data on top of stack 1.

For instance, if we want to concatenate the strings “Hello” and “World”, we can use the following script:
<pre>
OP_PUSHDATA1 0x05 48656c6c6f
OP_PUSHDATA1 0x05 576f726c64
OP_CAT
</pre>

The first two lines push the strings “Hello” and “World” onto the stack, respectively. The 0x05 in the first column of each line indicates the length of the string in bytes. The last line concatenates the two strings on top of the stack using the `OP_CAT` opcode 

Another more **visual example** of OP_CAT at work (*stacking stacks*):

<pre>
Initial Stack:                 Execute OP_CAT:               Final Stack:

+---------------------+        +---------------------+      +-----------------------------+
|         42          |        |    Concatenated     |      |        Concatenated         |
+---------------------+        |        Result       |      |           Result            |
|         73          |   ==>  |      (42 + 73)      |  ==> |          (42 + 73)          |
+---------------------+        +---------------------+      +-----------------------------+
|         91          |        |          91         |      |       (42 + 73 + 91)        |
+---------------------+        +---------------------+      +-----------------------------+
</pre>

In this example:

- The initial Stack contains three numbers: 42, 73, and 91.
- `OP_CAT` is executed, which concatenates the top two items on the stack (42 and 73).
- The result (42 + 73) is pushed back onto the stack.
- Another `OP_CAT` is executed, concatenating the previous result with the next number (91).
- The final stack contains the concatenated result of all three numbers (42 + 73 + 91).
