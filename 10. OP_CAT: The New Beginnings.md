## Ethan Heilman's mailing list

In 2023, Ethan Heilman introduced a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that has sparked significant interest and discussion within the cryptocurrency community. The proposal advocates for the reinstatement of the `OP_CAT` opcode in Tapscript, a move that could have profound implications for Bitcoin's scripting capabilities. To achieve this, a soft fork is proposed, involving the redefinition of the `OP_SUCCESS80` opcode.

`OP_CAT`, once present in early Bitcoin versions, was disabled due to concerns about script construction leading to an exponential increase in stack elements during evaluation. Notably, this concern has been mitigated in the contemporary era, with tapscript enforcing a maximum stack element size of 520 Bytes. [[13](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-October/022049.html)]

### **Motivation**

Bitcoin's tapscript seeks enhanced functionality, with `OP_CAT` proposed as a key solution. This opcode tackles the challenge of combining stack objects, unlocking various applications:

- *Bitstream Protocol:* Simplifies atomic swaps and decentralized file hosting in Bitcoin.
- *Tree Signatures:* Enables compact multisignature scripts with versatile spend conditions.
- *Post-Quantum Lamport Signatures:* Integrates Lamport signatures seamlessly into Bitcoin transactions.
- *Non-equivocation Contracts:* Provides a mechanism to penalize equivocation in payment channels.
- *Vaults:* Specialized covenants for securing funds, particularly useful amid compromised keys.
- *Replicating CheckSigFromStack:* Streamlines covenant and contract creation without the need for presigning.
  
Originally present in early Bitcoin versions, `OP_CAT` faced removal due to concerns related to memory usage. It allowed the creation of scripts that could lead to exponential memory consumption during evaluation. For instance, a script pushing a 1 Byte value and repeating `OP_DUP` and `OP_CAT` 40 times could result in a stack size exceeding 1 Terabyte. To address this, tapscript now imposes a maximum stack element size of 520 Bytes, **resolving the memory challenges** associated with `OP_CAT`.

### **Specification** 

`OP_CAT` pops two elements of the stack, concatenates them together in stack order and pushes the resultant element onto the stack. Given the stack [x1,x2], where x2 is at the top of the stack, `OP_CAT` will push x1||x2 onto the stack. By '||' we denote concatenation.

Implementation
<pre>
case OP_CAT:
{
    if (stack.size() < 2)
        return set_error(serror, SCRIPT_ERR_INVALID_STACK_OPERATION);
    valtype& vch1 = stacktop(-2);
    valtype& vch2 = stacktop(-1);
    if (vch1.size() + vch2.size() > MAX_SCRIPT_ELEMENT_SIZE)
        return set_error(serror, SCRIPT_ERR_INVALID_STACK_OPERATION);
    vch1.insert(vch1.end(), vch2.begin(), vch2.end());
    stack.pop_back();
}
break;
</pre>

This implementation is inspired by the original implementation of `OP_CAT` as shown below. An alternative implementation of OP_CAT can be found in Elements.
The value of MAX_SCRIPT_ELEMENT_SIZE is 520 Bytes. [[14](https://github.com/EthanHeilman/op_cat_draft/blob/main/cat.mediawiki)]

### **Notes**

`OP_CAT` as it existed in the Bitcoin codebase prior to the commit "misc changes" 4bd188c which disabled it.
<pre>
  // (x1 x2 -- out)
  if (stack.size() < 2)
    return false;
  valtype& vch1 = stacktop(-2);
  valtype& vch2 = stacktop(-1);
  vch1.insert(vch1.end(), vch2.begin(), vch2.end());
  stack.pop_back();
  if (stacktop(-1).size() > 5000)
    return false;
  }
</pre>

### **Importance of the BIP**

The reintroduction of `OP_CAT` has raised questions and curiosity among Bitcoin enthusiasts, as it holds the potential to enhance Tapscript's capabilities and offer new opportunities for developers. Heilman's proposal aims to address the limitations of Bitcoin tapscript, particularly in terms of combining objects on the stack. By providing a general-purpose way to concatenate stack values, `OP_CAT` could overcome these limitations and significantly broaden the functionality of tapscript.

The letter invites the community to review the proposal, highlighting the importance of collaborative discussions on the future of Bitcoin's scripting language. As discussions unfold, the cryptocurrency community eagerly anticipates the potential resurgence of `OP_CAT` and its positive impact on the Bitcoin ecosystem.
